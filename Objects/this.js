//A function that is a property of an object is called its method.
//user = {
//  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
//    alert("Hello");
//  }
//};
//shorthand

//To access the object, a method can use the 'this' keyword.
//this do not look at object definition. Only the moment of call matters.

//to chain methods return 'this' from methods of object
